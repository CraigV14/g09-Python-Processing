 ... I FELL INTO A REVERIE ... THE ATOMS WERE GAMBOLING BEFORE MY EYES
 ... I SAW HOW TWO SMALL ONES UNITED TO FORM A PAIR;
 HOW THE LARGER ONES SEIZED TWO OF THE SMALLER ONES;
 HOW STILL LARGER ONES KEPT HOLD OF THREE OR FOUR
 SMALLER ONES ... I SAW HOW THE LARGER ONES FORMED A CHAIN ...
 THIS WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE STRUCTURE THEORY.
